    "John Hopkins University (2019) states that \"school-life balance is important for optimal academic functioning\". Therefore, we believe that it is important for students to spend time socializing and building healthy relationships with others. By examining the data and using a classification model with K-nearest neighbours, we hope to find evidence supporting our hypothesis that if students have strong interpersonal relationships, their academic grade in Mathematics will be high.

    "For our data analysis, we will build a classification model using K-nearest neighbours. We will be predicting G3 (final grade) using romantic (with a romantic relationship), famrel (quality of family relationships), and goout (going out with friends) as predictors. \n",
    "G3 has a range of 0 to 20 and we believe that it would be too difficult to build a classification model with 20 possible labels. Therefore, we will be splitting up G3 using the following system: \n",
    "0 - 5 : Fail ; \n",
    "5 - 10 : Bad ; \n",
    "10 - 15 : Good ; \n",
    "15 - 20 : Excellent. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will also be mutating the column romantic from a binary to numeric one, with 1 representing “yes” and 2 representing “no”. \n",
    "\n",
    "One of the visualizations we can use to show our results is a scatterplot with two of the predictors on the x and y-axis, and colours for the labels of final grades. We can also use a confusion matrix to show the accuracy of our model. "

    "\n",
    "If our hypothesis is proven to be correct and the quality of students’ relationships is found to be an accurate predictor for their academic performance, it will serve as evidence to support the need of a healthy school-life balance. Students are often too focused on studying and academics, so they should remember to regularly spend time with family and friends! \n",
    "\n",
    "Since the dataset we are using in our project only includes Mathematics grades, future research should be done to explore the effects on other subjects as well. In addition, it will be interesting to see whether the results are supported by data from students in other countries. \n"
